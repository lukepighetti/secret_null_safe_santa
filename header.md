# Secret Null Safe Santa 🎅

This repo is updated daily and contains a list of popular packages that have not migrated to null-safety. [@filiphracek](https://twitter.com/filiphracek/status/1370634483746021382) has an internal tracker whose results are published [here](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/wiki/Null-safety-migration-status).

The Dart ecosystem is currently migrating to null-safety. This is a monumental task and there are still some critical packages that have not been migrated. See this [Dart migration guide](https://dart.dev/null-safety/migration-guide) and this [Flutter null-safety guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/null-safety)

Community members, please help migrate these packages to null-safety.

Package maintainers, please make yourself available to triage this work.
